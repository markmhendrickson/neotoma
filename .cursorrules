# Cursor Rules for Neotoma

## Git Workflow

### Pulling from dev branch
When asked to pull recent changes from the dev branch (on main worktree) into the current worktree, use:
```bash
git fetch origin dev && git merge origin/dev
```

This fetches the latest `dev` branch from origin and merges it into the current branch without switching branches.
