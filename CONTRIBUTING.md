# Contributing to Neotoma

Neotoma is in active development. The work is in the open at [github.com/markmhendrickson/neotoma](https://github.com/markmhendrickson/neotoma).

## Current Status

We are working toward a developer preview and v1.0.0 MVP. If you are interested in collaboration or early access:

- Open an issue or discussion on GitHub.
- Review [Core identity](docs/foundation/core_identity.md) and [Philosophy](docs/foundation/philosophy.md).
- Read [Development workflow](docs/developer/development_workflow.md) and [Getting started](docs/developer/getting_started.md).

## When We Open for Contributions

When Neotoma is ready for public contributions, we will:

- Use the Feature Unit workflow for all changes.
- Require tests and documentation per [Testing standard](docs/testing/testing_standard.md) and [Documentation standards](docs/conventions/documentation_standards_rules.mdc).
- Apply security review for sensitive changes (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)).

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful, constructive, and professional in all interactions.
