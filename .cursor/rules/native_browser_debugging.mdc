# Native Browser Debugging Rule

## Purpose

Ensure debugging and verification use the native browser for UI flows.

## Trigger Patterns

When investigating or verifying UI issues, OAuth flows, or frontend behavior.

## Agent Actions

1. Use the native browser tools for reproduction and verification.
2. **Check browser console for errors** when making UI changes:
   - Use browser MCP tools (`browser_console_messages`) to check for console errors
   - Verify no `Uncaught SyntaxError`, `Uncaught TypeError`, or missing export errors
   - Fix all console errors before marking UI changes complete
3. Capture runtime evidence in the native browser before claiming resolution.
4. Use Playwright only as supplemental coverage, not as the primary confirmation step.

## Constraints

- MUST use the native browser to reproduce UI issues when possible.
- MUST use the native browser to confirm fixes for UI flows.
- **MUST check browser console for errors** when making UI-impacting changes.
- **MUST fix all console errors** (import/export errors, runtime errors) before marking UI changes complete.
- MUST NOT claim UI fixes without native browser confirmation.
- **MUST NOT mark UI changes complete** if console errors exist.

## Agent Instructions

### When to Load This Document

Load when debugging UI flows or confirming UI fixes.

### Required Co-Loaded Documents

- Repository documentation standards

### Constraints Agents Must Enforce

1. Use native browser tooling for UI debugging and verification.
2. Collect runtime evidence from the native browser before concluding resolution.
3. Check browser console for errors after all UI changes.
4. Fix all console errors before marking UI work complete.

### Forbidden Patterns

- Declaring UI bugs fixed without native browser verification.
- Relying only on headless tests for UI verification.
- Ignoring console errors in the browser.
- Marking UI changes complete with console errors present.

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] Native browser used to reproduce the issue
- [ ] Native browser used to confirm the fix
- [ ] **Browser console checked for errors** (using `browser_console_messages` MCP tool)
- [ ] **No console errors present** (no import/export errors, no runtime errors)
- [ ] Runtime evidence captured during reproduction and verification
