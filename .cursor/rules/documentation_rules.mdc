# Documentation Rules

Rules for creating and maintaining documentation files to minimize context window usage while maintaining clarity.

## Core Principles

**Minimize context usage:** Every word, section, and file consumes context. Remove anything that doesn't directly serve the reader's immediate need.

**Single source of truth:** Each concept, rule, or process documented once. Reference, don't duplicate.

**Concise language:** Use the shortest clear phrasing. Prefer direct statements over explanations.

## Content Rules

### Avoid Redundancy

**Within files:**
- Don't repeat the same rule in multiple sections
- Don't restate the title in the first paragraph
- Don't summarize what you're about to say before saying it

**Between files:**
- Don't duplicate rules across multiple files
- Reference other files instead of copying content
- If overlap exists, consolidate into one file and reference it

**Examples:**
- Bad: "This document defines requirements. The requirements are defined below."
- Good: "Requirements:"

### Remove Unnecessary Elements

**Don't include:**
- "Related Documentation" sections (use file structure and naming for discovery)
- Meta properties (Status, Last Updated, Related) in file headers
- Separator lines (`---`) unless grouping distinct sections
- Empty lines between every section (use sparingly)
- Introductory paragraphs that restate the title
- "Purpose" sections that repeat the filename
- Closing summaries that restate what was said

**Do include:**
- Direct statements of rules or requirements
- Essential context only
- Examples when they clarify ambiguity

### Language Conciseness

**Use:**
- Direct commands: "Do X" not "Agents should do X" or "It is recommended that agents do X"
- Short phrases: "Required" not "This is a mandatory requirement"
- Active voice: "Create file" not "File should be created"
- Lists over paragraphs when possible
- Specific terms over general ones

**Avoid:**
- Hedging language: "should", "may", "consider" (use "must" or "do not")
- Filler phrases: "in order to", "for the purpose of", "it is important to note"
- Redundant qualifiers: "very important", "absolutely required"
- Explanatory preambles: "The reason for this is..." (state the rule, not why it exists unless critical)

### Structure

**File organization:**
- Start with title (no preamble)
- Use `##` for main sections
- Use `###` for subsections
- Use lists for multiple items
- Group related rules together

**Section naming:**
- Use action-oriented names: "Creating Files" not "File Creation Process"
- Keep names short: "Rules" not "Rules and Guidelines"
- Avoid generic names: "Requirements" not "General Information"

## Formatting Rules

**Minimal formatting:**
- Use `**bold**` only for emphasis on key terms or mandatory markers
- Use `*italic*` sparingly
- Avoid nested formatting
- Use code blocks only for actual code or file paths
- Use inline code for file paths, commands, field names

**Lists:**
- Prefer bullet lists over numbered lists unless sequence matters
- Use short items (one line when possible)
- Don't add punctuation to list items unless needed for clarity

## File Creation

**Before creating a new file:**
1. Check if the content belongs in an existing file
2. Check if similar content exists elsewhere
3. Consider if a reference would suffice

**File naming:**
- Use descriptive, specific names
- Avoid generic terms: "guide", "manual", "documentation"
- Prefer action-oriented names: "data-entry-requirements.md" not "data-entry-guide.md"

**File size:**
- Keep files focused on a single domain or topic
- If a file grows beyond ~300 lines, consider splitting
- Prefer multiple focused files over one large file

## Maintenance

**When updating:**
- Remove outdated content immediately
- Consolidate duplicate rules
- Remove sections that no longer apply
- Update references if files are renamed or merged

**When referencing:**
- Use file paths, not "see above" or "as mentioned"
- Reference specific files, not "related documentation"
- Don't create cross-reference sections
