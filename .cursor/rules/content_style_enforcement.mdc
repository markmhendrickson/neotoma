# Content Style Enforcement Rule

**Reference:** `foundation/conventions/writing_style_guide.md` — Writing style guide

Ensures all content (essays, articles, posts, documentation) always follows anti-AI patterns and authentic human voice standards.

## Trigger Patterns

When creating or editing ANY content:
- Essays, articles, blog posts
- Social media content
- Documentation
- Marketing copy
- Technical writing
- Any written content for publication

## Agent Actions

### Step 1: Load Style Guide

Before finalizing any content:
1. Load `foundation/conventions/writing_style_guide.md`
2. Review prohibited patterns
3. Apply all style rules

### Step 2: Apply Anti-AI Patterns

Before finalizing any content, MUST remove all AI-generated language patterns per the writing style guide:

**Generic AI Phrases to Remove:**
- "Furthermore", "Moreover", "In addition"
- "leverage" → use "use" or "draw on"
- "empower" → use "enable" or "let"
- "cutting-edge" → use specific technical terms
- "revolutionary", "game-changing", "seamless" → remove marketing hype

**Corporate Speak to Reduce:**
- "solution" → use specific description
- "platform" → use "tool" or "system" where appropriate
- "ecosystem" → use only when necessary, prefer specific names

**Language Simplification:**
- "utilize" → "use"
- "facilitate" → "enable" or "help"
- "remembrances" → "memories"
- "structural foundation" → "foundation"
- Passive voice → Active voice ("it was found" → "I found")

**Punctuation Patterns (AI-Generated Tendencies):**
- NEVER use em dashes (—) or en dashes (–)
- Use commas for appositives and lists
- Use periods to separate ideas
- Use colons to introduce lists or explanations
- Use standard hyphens (-) for compound words and ranges

**Conversational Transitions (AI-Generated Tendencies):**
- NEVER use: "Now, let's...", "So, you might...", "Interestingly...", "As you can see...", "Keep in mind that..."
- Use direct statements without transition words
- Start with the subject directly

**Soft Questions and Offers (AI-Generated Tendencies):**
- NEVER use: "Would you like to...?", "Have you considered...?", "Want to try...?", "Need help with...?"
- Use direct instructions: "Use the `store_record` action to..."
- Use declarative statements: "The system supports..."

**Motivational Language (AI-Generated Tendencies):**
- NEVER use: "Get started!", "Try it now!", "You're all set!", "Ready to go!", "Let's dive in!"
- Use neutral completion statements: "Setup is complete."
- Use direct next steps: "Next, configure environment variables."

**Excessive Parentheticals (AI-Generated Tendencies):**
- NEVER use multiple parenthetical asides in one sentence
- NEVER use long explanatory parentheticals that break flow
- Use separate sentences for explanations
- Use commas for brief clarifications

**Redundant Qualifiers (AI-Generated Tendencies):**
- NEVER use: "very", "quite", "rather", "somewhat", "pretty", "incredibly", "extremely", "highly"
- Use direct adjectives: "fast" not "very fast"
- Use specific measurements when available: "processes 100 files/second" not "very quickly"

**Complex Sentence Structures (AI-Generated Tendencies):**
- NEVER use overly nested clauses
- NEVER use multiple dependent clauses in one sentence
- NEVER use sentences over 25 words
- Use simple, short sentences (15-20 words)
- Use one idea per sentence
- Break complex thoughts into multiple sentences

### Step 3: Verify Authentic Human Voice

Content MUST have:
- Conversational but professional tone
- First person where appropriate ("I built this", "When I use...")
- Personal insights and examples
- Natural language flow (contractions, varied sentence length)
- Active voice preferred
- Direct, clear statements
- Simple, declarative sentences

### Step 4: Quality Check

Before completing content work:
1. Scan for AI phrases listed above
2. Replace with natural alternatives
3. Verify active voice throughout
4. Check for personal insights/examples
5. Read aloud to verify natural flow
6. Search for em dashes (—) and en dashes (–) and replace
7. Remove conversational transitions
8. Remove soft questions and motivational language
9. Simplify complex sentences
10. Remove redundant qualifiers

## Constraints

- MUST apply anti-AI patterns to ALL content before finalizing
- MUST NOT skip style enforcement to save time
- MUST verify authentic human voice in every piece
- MUST remove generic AI phrases even if content is AI-generated initially
- MUST use active voice unless passive is clearly better
- MUST NOT use em dashes (—) or en dashes (–)
- MUST NOT use conversational transitions ("Now, let's...", "So, you might...")
- MUST NOT use soft questions ("Would you like to...?", "Have you considered...?")
- MUST NOT use motivational language ("Get started!", "Try it now!")
- MUST NOT use excessive parentheticals
- MUST NOT use redundant qualifiers ("very", "quite", "rather")
- MUST use simple, declarative sentences (15-20 words, one idea per sentence)
