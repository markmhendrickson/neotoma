# UI Workflow (DEPRECATED)

**⚠️ DEPRECATED:** This command is replaced by the new checkpoint-based Feature Unit workflow.

**Use this workflow instead:**
1. `Create New Feature Unit` (Checkpoint 0) — collects spec + UX requirements
2. `Create Prototype` — builds interactive prototype with mocked APIs
3. Review and approve prototype (Checkpoint 1)
4. `Run Feature Workflow` — implements UI using prototype as reference
5. `Final Review` (Checkpoint 2)

**See:** `docs/feature_units/standards/creating_feature_units.md` for the complete workflow.

**Legacy DSL-based approach:**
This command used a DSL → Design → Implementation flow, which is superseded by the prototype-first approach that provides better UX validation and faster iteration.
