# Setup Foundation Commands Only

Sets up symlinks from foundation cursor **commands** to `.cursor/commands/`. Does not link or change rules.

## Command

```
setup_commands
```

or

```
setup commands
```

## Purpose

This command runs `foundation/scripts/setup_cursor_commands.sh`, which:

1. Creates symlinks from `foundation/agent_instructions/cursor_commands/` to `.cursor/commands/`
2. Uses original filenames (no prefix)
3. Removes existing foundation command symlinks before creating new ones
4. Preserves non-symlink files (e.g. repo-specific commands like `migrate_plans.md`)
5. **Does not touch** `.cursor/rules/` or repo rules from `docs/`

Use this when you only want foundation commands (e.g. commit, pull, push) without linking rules. Use `/setup_symlinks` to link both rules and commands.

## When to Use

- When you want foundation commands (commit, pull, push, etc.) but keep repo-specific rules
- After updating the foundation submodule and you only need commands refreshed
- When rules are managed separately (e.g. via setup_cursor_copies)

## Execution Instructions

### Step 1: Verify Foundation Directory

- Look for `foundation/` in repo root, or `../foundation/` if in a subdirectory
- If not found, error: "Foundation directory not found. Please ensure foundation is installed."

### Step 2: Run Setup Script

**Execute:**

```bash
./foundation/scripts/setup_cursor_commands.sh
```

**Or if foundation is in parent directory:**

```bash
../foundation/scripts/setup_cursor_commands.sh
```

### Step 3: Verify Results

- Check `.cursor/commands/` for symlinks to foundation commands (e.g. `commit.md`, `pull.md`, `push.md`)
- Repo-specific command files (e.g. `migrate_plans.md`) are left unchanged
- `.cursor/rules/` is not modified

## What Gets Created

**Symlinks in `.cursor/commands/`:**

- `commit.md` → `foundation/agent_instructions/cursor_commands/commit.md`
- `pull.md` → `foundation/agent_instructions/cursor_commands/pull.md`
- `push.md` → `foundation/agent_instructions/cursor_commands/push.md`
- ... (all other foundation commands, same filenames)

## Related

- **Setup rules and commands:** `/setup_symlinks` runs `setup_cursor_rules.sh` (rules + commands + repo rules from docs)
- **Foundation commands source:** `foundation/agent_instructions/cursor_commands/`
