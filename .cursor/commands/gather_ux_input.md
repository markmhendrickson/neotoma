# Gather UX Input (DEPRECATED)

**⚠️ DEPRECATED:** This command is obsolete. UX input is now collected as part of `Create New Feature Unit` (Checkpoint 0).

If you need to add UX requirements to an existing spec, edit the spec directly or re-run `Create New Feature Unit` which will collect UX requirements if UI changes are present.

**See:** `docs/feature_units/standards/creating_feature_units.md` for the current workflow.
