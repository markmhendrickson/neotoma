# Old Vanilla JS App

This directory contains the original vanilla JavaScript implementation that was migrated to React.

Files:
- `app.js` - Main application logic
- `chat.js` - Chat interface
- `index.html` - Original HTML structure
- `styles.css` - Original CSS styles

These files have been replaced by the React implementation in `frontend/` and are kept here for reference.
