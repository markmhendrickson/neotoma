# Social Media Conventions Rules

## Purpose

Ensures consistent, professional social media content (tweets, posts) that maintains clarity and readability.

## Trigger Patterns

Agents MUST apply these rules when:
- Drafting tweets or social media posts
- Creating announcement content for Twitter/X, LinkedIn, or similar platforms
- Reviewing or revising social media copy

## Complete Sentences

**MUST use complete sentences for tweets and social media posts.**

- Every clause must have a subject and verb
- Avoid sentence fragments, trailing phrases, or standalone imperatives
- Use proper punctuation

**Examples:**
- "Early build, feedback welcome." → "This is an early build, and feedback is welcome."
- "Still experimental." → "This release is still experimental."
- "Try it and tell us what breaks." → "Try it and tell us what breaks." (already complete)

## Constraints

- All tweets and social media posts MUST use complete sentences
- Fragment-style copy (e.g., "Experimental. Use at your own risk.") MUST be rewritten as full sentences
