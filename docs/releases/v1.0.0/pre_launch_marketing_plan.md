## Release v1.0.0 — Build-in-Public Content Plan

### Purpose
This document defines build-in-public content activities for v1.0.0 during the build phase (dogfooding-first approach). Focus is on technical thought leadership, community engagement, and reactive content to industry announcements, plus a developer preview release during dogfooding with precision disclaimers.

**Key Changes from Original Pre-Launch Marketing Plan:**
- ❌ **Removed**: Waitlist building, early access beta, formal pre-launch marketing
- ✅ **Added**: Build-in-public content, reactive content to industry announcements, MCP ecosystem engagement
- ✅ **Added**: Developer preview release during dogfooding with precision disclaimers
- ✅ **Reframed**: Technical thought leadership instead of product marketing
- ✅ **Timeline**: Week 0-12 (during build), not Week -4 to Week 0 (before build)
- ✅ **Approach**: Building for personal use (ateles integration), sharing learnings

### 8. Success Criteria

**Build-in-Public Content**:
- Technical credibility established (thought leadership positioning)
- Community engagement (MCP ecosystem, relevant discussions)
- Visibility during industry announcements (reactive content gets 3-5x engagement)
- No premature commitments (no waitlist/beta expectations)

**Content Performance**:
- ≥2000 blog post views (across all posts)
- ≥500 demo video views (if created)
- ≥50 content shares (organic)
- ≥3% Twitter/X engagement rate
- ≥2% LinkedIn engagement rate

**MCP Ecosystem Engagement**:
- ≥50 MCP ecosystem engagements (comments, replies, shares)
- ≥20 community mentions (Discord, Reddit)
- ≥10 technical contributions (helpful answers, insights)

**Reactive Content**:
- ≥3-5 industry announcement responses (within 24-48 hours)
- 3-5x engagement on reactive content (vs. scheduled content)

**Personal Brand**:
- Increase Twitter/X followers by 10% (from existing base)
- Increase LinkedIn connections by 5% (from existing base)
- Establish Neotoma as recognized project in AI memory space
- Build reputation as helpful community member

**No Waitlist/Beta Metrics**: Just content engagement and community participation
### 9. Agent-Based Automation (Optional)

#### 9.1 Content Generation Automation
**Strategy**: Use AI agents (Claude/ChatGPT via MCP or direct API) to generate content drafts based on build-in-public schedule.
**Agent Workflow**:
1. **Weekly Schedule Reading**
   - Agent reads build-in-public content plan
   - Identifies content needs for upcoming week (Twitter threads, blog posts, LinkedIn posts)
   - Creates content generation tasks

2. **Content Generation**
   - Agent generates content drafts following templates and brand guidelines
   - Uses build progress data for context
   - Outputs platform-specific formats (Twitter threads, blog posts, LinkedIn posts)
   - **No waitlist CTAs**: Just technical content

3. **Content Review** (Human-in-the-loop)
   - Review generated content for quality and brand voice
   - Approve or request revisions
   - Store approved content for publishing

**Agent Instructions**:
- Follow brand voice: technical, authentic, privacy-first, build-in-public
- Lead with defensible differentiators (privacy-first, deterministic, cross-platform)
- Use thread structure templates (no CTAs)
- **No waitlist links**: Just technical content
- Maintain consistency across platforms

**Content Templates for Agents**:
- Twitter thread template (5-7 tweets, hook → problem → how I'm solving it → technical details → what I'm learning)
- Blog post template (1500-2500 words, intro → body → conclusion, no CTA)
- LinkedIn post template (300-500 words, professional tone, no CTA)
- Build-in-public update template (honest, progress, learnings)

**MVP Approach**:
- Use Claude/ChatGPT directly (via MCP or web interface) to generate content drafts
- Provide agent with build progress and technical learnings
- Review and approve generated content before publishing
- Manual publishing (automated publishing in post-MVP)

**Time Savings**:
- Content generation: ~70% time reduction (from 15 hours/month to ~5 hours/month)
- Agent generates drafts, human reviews and publishes
- Focus human time on review, refinement, and community engagement

#### 9.2 Scheduling Automation (Post-MVP)
**Future**: Automated scheduling and publishing agents (see `marketing_automation_plan.md`)
### 10. Budget
- **Total**: $0 (organic only)
- **Time Investment**: ~10-15 hours/month (build-in-public content, not marketing)
  - Agent content generation: ~2 hours (prompting, reviewing, refining)
  - Twitter/X threads: ~3 hours (agent drafts + review + publishing)
  - Blog posts: ~4 hours (agent drafts + review + editing + publishing, monthly)
  - Demo video: ~3 hours (optional, if time permits)
  - LinkedIn posts: ~1 hour (agent drafts + review + publishing, monthly)
  - Indie Hackers posts: ~1 hour (weekly updates)
  - Website updates: ~2 hours (setup, optimization)
  - Community engagement: ~3 hours (MCP ecosystem, relevant discussions)
  - Reactive content: ~2-3 hours per industry announcement (as needed)
  - MCP directory preparation: ~1 hour (optional, for post-dogfooding)
- **Agent Costs**: ~$10-20/month (Claude/ChatGPT API for content generation)
