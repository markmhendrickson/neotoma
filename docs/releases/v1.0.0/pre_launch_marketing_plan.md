### 9. Agent-Based Automation
#### 9.1 Content Generation Automation
**Strategy**: Use AI agents (Claude/ChatGPT via MCP or direct API) to generate content drafts based on marketing schedule.
**Agent Workflow**:
1. **Weekly Schedule Reading**
   - Agent reads `pre_launch_marketing_plan.md` weekly schedule
   - Identifies content needs for upcoming week (Twitter threads, blog posts, LinkedIn posts)
   - Creates content generation tasks
2. **Content Generation**
   - Agent generates content drafts following templates and brand guidelines
   - Uses release data (`release_report.md`, `manifest.yaml`) for context
   - Outputs platform-specific formats (Twitter threads, blog posts, LinkedIn posts)
3. **Content Review** (Human-in-the-loop)
   - Review generated content for quality and brand voice
   - Approve or request revisions
   - Store approved content for publishing
**Agent Instructions**:
- Follow brand voice: technical, authentic, privacy-first
- Lead with defensible differentiators (privacy-first, deterministic, cross-platform)
- Use thread structure templates from Section 2.2
- Include relevant CTAs (waitlist links with UTM parameters)
- Maintain consistency across platforms
**Content Templates for Agents**:
- Twitter thread template (5-7 tweets, hook → problem → solution → CTA)
- Blog post template (1500-2500 words, intro → body → conclusion → CTA)
- LinkedIn post template (300-500 words, professional tone, CTA)
- Build-in-public update template (honest, metrics, learnings)
**MVP Approach**:
- Use Claude/ChatGPT directly (via MCP or web interface) to generate content drafts
- Provide agent with marketing schedule and release data
- Review and approve generated content before publishing
- Manual publishing (automated publishing in post-MVP)
**Time Savings**:
- Content generation: ~70% time reduction (from 60 hours to ~18 hours)
- Agent generates drafts, human reviews and publishes
- Focus human time on review, refinement, and community engagement
#### 9.2 Scheduling Automation (Post-MVP)
**Future**: Automated scheduling and publishing agents (see `marketing_automation_plan.md`)
