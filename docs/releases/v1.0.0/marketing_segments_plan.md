### 4. Messaging Framework

**Core Value Propositions (Lead with Defensible Differentiators):**

- **For AI-Native Operators**: "Privacy-first memory for ChatGPT, Claude, and Cursor. User-controlled, cross-platform via MCP."
- **For Knowledge Workers**: "Privacy-first structured memory with deterministic extraction. User-controlled, no provider access."
- **For Privacy-Conscious Users**: "User-controlled memory that's never used for training. You own your data."

**Key Messages (Defensible Differentiators First):**

1. **Privacy-first architecture** — User-controlled, no provider access, never used for training (vs. provider-controlled memory)
2. **Deterministic extraction** — Same input → same output, always; reproducible, explainable (vs. ML-based probabilistic)
3. **Cross-platform access** — Works with ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor via MCP (vs. platform-locked memory)
4. **Feature capabilities** — Entity resolution, timelines, dual-path ingestion (enabled by defensible differentiators)

**Why This Matters:**

- Competitors (model providers, startups) are developing similar features (structured memory, entity resolution, timelines)
- Neotoma's defensible differentiators (privacy-first, deterministic, cross-platform) are what competitors cannot pursue due to structural constraints
- Lead with defensible differentiators, not features alone

**Strategic Messaging:**

- "Privacy-first deterministic memory for AI tools"
- "User-controlled, cross-platform via MCP"
- "Upload once, query forever — across all your AI tools"
- "Your data, your control, your memory"
