**Date**: 2026-01-15  
**Purpose**: Assess whether pre-launch marketing activities make sense for dogfooding-first approach

## Executive Summary

**Short Answer**: **No, traditional pre-launch marketing doesn't make sense for dogfooding-first approach.**

- Authentic storytelling
- Technical credibility
- Community engagement
- Future marketing foundation

---

## 1. Pre-Launch Marketing Activities (Discovery-First Context)

### Traditional Pre-Launch Marketing (Week -4 to Week 0):
1. **Waitlist Building** (Week -4 to Week 0)
   - Goal: ≥100 waitlist signups
   - Channels: Twitter, LinkedIn, blog, Indie Hackers, Hacker News
   - CTA: "Join waitlist for early access"

2. **Early Access Beta** (Week -2)
   - Goal: ≥25 beta participants, ≥70% activation rate
   - Invite: Discovery participants + top 20 waitlist
   - Expectation: Working product ready for external users

3. **Content Teasers** (Week -4 to Week 0)
   - Blog posts, demo videos, Twitter threads
   - Purpose: Build anticipation, generate awareness
   - CTA: Join waitlist

4. **Competitor Follower Outreach** (Week -4 to Week 0)
   - Value-first engagement with competitor users
   - Goal: Generate waitlist signups

5. **MCP Directory Listings** (Week -3 to Week 0)
   - Submit to 8+ MCP directories
   - Goal: Visibility, referral traffic, waitlist signups

**Time Investment**: ~35 hours  
**Assumption**: Product is ready for external users (or will be by launch)

## 2. Why Pre-Launch Marketing Doesn't Fit Dogfooding-First

### 2.1 Timing Mismatch

**Pre-Launch Marketing Assumes:**
- Product is being built for external users
- External validation has occurred (discovery)
- Product will be ready for external users by launch
- Waitlist/beta creates anticipation for known launch date

**Dogfooding-First Reality:**
- Product is being built for personal use (ateles integration)
- No external validation yet
- Product may not be ready for external users until after dogfooding
- Launch date is uncertain (depends on dogfooding validation)

**Problem**: Building waitlist before you know if product works for yourself creates premature expectations.

### 2.2 Premature Expectations

**Risks of Pre-Launch Marketing in Dogfooding-First:**
- ❌ **Waitlist signups expect product**: If dogfooding reveals major issues, you can't deliver
- ❌ **Beta participants expect working product**: If product isn't ready, beta fails
- ❌ **Public commitment**: Waitlist/beta creates public commitment to launch timeline
- ❌ **Reputation risk**: If product doesn't work for you, external users will be disappointed

**Example Scenario:**
- Week -4: Launch waitlist, get 100 signups
- Week 0-12: Build MVP for ateles integration
- Week 12: Dogfooding reveals major issues, product doesn't work well
- **Result**: 100 waitlist signups expecting product, but you can't deliver

### 2.3 Resource Allocation

**Pre-Launch Marketing Time Investment:**
- Waitlist building: ~10 hours
- Content creation: ~15 hours (blog posts, Twitter threads, demo video)
- Beta management: ~5 hours
- Competitor outreach: ~3 hours
- MCP directory listings: ~2 hours
- **Total**: ~35 hours

**Dogfooding-First Priority:**
- Focus all time on building
- No time for marketing activities
- Marketing deferred until after dogfooding validation

**Problem**: Pre-launch marketing diverts time from building.

### 2.4 Authenticity Gap

**Pre-Launch Marketing Message:**
- "Join the waitlist for Neotoma - a privacy-first truth layer for AI memory"
- Implies: Product is being built for you (external users)
- Expectation: Product will be ready for external users

**Dogfooding-First Reality:**
- "I'm building Neotoma for my own use (ateles integration)"
- Implies: Product is being built for personal use first
- Expectation: Product may or may not be ready for external users

**Problem**: Pre-launch marketing message doesn't match dogfooding-first approach.

## 3. What Makes Sense: Build-in-Public Content

### 3.1 Build-in-Public vs. Pre-Launch Marketing

**Build-in-Public Content** (No Waitlist/Beta):
- ✅ Share progress, learnings, technical deep-dives
- ✅ Authentic storytelling: "I'm building this for myself"
- ✅ No commitment to external launch
- ✅ No waitlist/beta expectations
- ✅ Focus on technical content, not marketing

**Pre-Launch Marketing** (With Waitlist/Beta):
- ❌ Build anticipation for external launch
- ❌ Create waitlist/beta expectations
- ❌ Commit to launch timeline
- ❌ Focus on marketing, not just building

### 3.2 Build-in-Public Activities That Make Sense

**1. Technical Threads (Twitter/X)**
- "Building Neotoma for my ateles integration - here's what I'm learning about deterministic extraction"
- "Replacing parquet MCP with Neotoma - MCP integration patterns I'm discovering"
- "Why I'm building a truth layer instead of using semantic search"
- **No CTA**: Just sharing learnings, not asking for waitlist signups

**2. Blog Posts (Personal Website)**
- "Why I'm Building Neotoma: Solving My Own Problem with AI Memory"
- "Deterministic Extraction: Technical Deep-Dive from Building Neotoma"
- "MCP Integration Patterns: Lessons from Replacing Parquet MCP"
- **No CTA**: Just technical content, not marketing

**3. Indie Hackers Build-in-Public Posts**
- Weekly progress updates
- Challenges faced, learnings
- Screenshots, demos
- **No CTA**: Just sharing journey, not asking for signups

**4. Hacker News "Show HN" (After Dogfooding)**
- Post after dogfooding validation
- "Show HN: Neotoma - Privacy-first truth layer I built for my ateles integration"
- **Timing**: After dogfooding, not before

**Time Investment**: ~10-15 hours (vs. 35 hours for pre-launch marketing)  
**Focus**: Technical content, not marketing

## 4. Marketing Timeline for Dogfooding-First

### 4.1 Recommended Timeline

**Phase 1: Build + Dogfooding (Week 0-12)**
- Build MVP for ateles integration
- Dogfooding: Real usage, real validation
- **Build-in-Public Content**: Share progress, learnings (optional, low time investment)
- **No Pre-Launch Marketing**: No waitlist, no beta, no formal marketing

**Phase 2: Post-Dogfooding Validation (Week 12-13)**
- Assess: Does product work for ateles integration?
- Decision: Proceed to external launch or iterate?

**Phase 3: Discovery (Week 13-16) - If Proceeding**
- Conduct discovery with working product
- Validate market fit, pricing, competitive positioning
- **Advantage**: Can show working product in interviews

**Phase 4: Marketing Launch (Week 16-20) - If Proceeding**
- Launch waitlist (now that product is validated)
- Launch beta (now that product works)
- Launch announcement (now that you have confidence)

**Total Timeline**: ~20 weeks (vs. 15-16 weeks for discovery-first)

### 4.2 Build-in-Public Content During Dogfooding

**Optional Activities (Low Time Investment):**
- **Twitter threads**: Share technical learnings (1-2 hours/week)
- **Blog posts**: Technical deep-dives (2-3 hours/month)
- **Indie Hackers**: Weekly progress updates (1 hour/week)
- **No waitlist/beta**: Just sharing, not marketing

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Authentic storytelling
- ✅ Technical credibility
- ✅ Community engagement
- ✅ Foundation for future marketing
- ✅ Low time investment (~5-10 hours/month)

**Risks:**
- ❌ May generate interest you can't fulfill yet
- ❌ People may ask for access before product is ready

**Mitigation:**
- Be clear: "Building for my own use, not ready for external users yet"
- No waitlist/beta CTAs
- Focus on technical content, not product marketing

| Aspect | Pre-Launch Marketing | Build-in-Public |
|--------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Timeline** | Week -4 to Week 0 | Ongoing (during build) |
| **Goal** | Build waitlist, generate anticipation | Share progress, build credibility |
| **CTA** | "Join waitlist", "Sign up for beta" | None (just sharing) |
| **Expectation** | Product ready for external users | Product for personal use |
| **Time Investment** | ~35 hours | ~5-10 hours/month |
| **Commitment** | High (public launch promise) | Low (just sharing) |
| **Risk** | High (can't deliver on expectations) | Low (no expectations) |
| **Authenticity** | Medium (marketing-focused) | High (authentic storytelling) |

## 6. Recommendation

### For Dogfooding-First Approach:

**❌ Don't Do:**
- Waitlist building (premature expectations)
- Early access beta (product not ready for external users)
- Formal pre-launch marketing (timing mismatch)
- MCP directory listings (product not ready)
- Competitor follower outreach with waitlist CTAs

**✅ Do Instead:**
- **Build-in-Public Content** (optional, low time investment):
  - Technical threads on Twitter (share learnings)
  - Blog posts (technical deep-dives)
  - Indie Hackers progress updates
  - **No waitlist/beta CTAs** - just sharing
- **Post-Dogfooding Marketing** (after validation):
  - Launch waitlist (now that product is validated)
  - Launch beta (now that product works)
  - Launch announcement (now that you have confidence)

### Build-in-Public Content Strategy:

**Week 0-12 (During Build):**
- Share technical learnings (determinism, MCP integration, entity resolution)
- Share progress updates (screenshots, demos)
- Share challenges faced, solutions found
- **Message**: "Building for my own use (ateles integration), here's what I'm learning"
- **No CTA**: Just sharing, not marketing

**Week 12+ (After Dogfooding):**
- If product works: Proceed to discovery + marketing
- If product doesn't work: Iterate, continue building in public

**Time Investment**: ~5-10 hours/month (vs. 35 hours for pre-launch marketing)

---

## 7. Exception: If You're Confident

**If you're highly confident the product will work for external users:**
- You could do **light pre-launch marketing** (waitlist only, no beta)
- But this contradicts dogfooding-first approach (uncertainty is the point)
- **Recommendation**: Stick with build-in-public, defer formal marketing

---

## 8. Conclusion

**Pre-Launch Marketing for Dogfooding-First:**
- ❌ **Doesn't make sense**: Timing mismatch, premature expectations, resource diversion
- ✅ **Build-in-Public makes sense**: Authentic storytelling, technical credibility, low time investment
- ✅ **Post-Dogfooding Marketing makes sense**: After validation, with working product

**Recommended Approach:**
1. **Build + Dogfooding** (Week 0-12): Build-in-public content (optional, low time investment)
2. **Post-Dogfooding Validation** (Week 12-13): Assess if product works
3. **Discovery** (Week 13-16): If proceeding, validate market fit with working product
4. **Marketing Launch** (Week 16-20): If proceeding, launch waitlist/beta/announcement

**Key Principle**: Don't create external expectations until you've validated the product works for yourself.
