  value_discovery:
    hypothesis: "AI-Native Individual Operators need a way to give AI tools (Claude/ChatGPT) access to their personal data context via MCP"
    method: "Hybrid: Async screening survey + Live interviews (Mom Test methodology)"
    participants:
      - segment: "AI-Native Individual Operators"
        count: 8
      - segment: "High-Context Knowledge Workers"
        count: 5
    timeline: "Week -8 to Week -6"
    success_criteria:
      - "Screening survey: 40-50 responses, 20-25 willing to interview"
      - "Live interviews: ≥70% validate problem exists (struggle to give AI tools access to personal data context)"
      - "Live interviews: ≥60% express interest in MCP-based solution (only after problem validated)"
      - "Live interviews: ≥50% care about deterministic, structured data access (vs semantic search)"
      - "Live interviews: ≥60% see value in 'upload once, query forever' workflow"
      - "Live interviews: Commitment signals present in ≥70% of interviews"

  usability_discovery:
    hypothesis: "Users can complete upload → extraction → MCP query workflow without guidance, and understand how to ask AI questions about their personal data"
    method: "Prototype user testing (live, requires observation and think-aloud protocol)"
    participants:
      - segment: "AI-Native Individual Operators"
        count: 5
      - segment: "High-Context Knowledge Workers"
        count: 3
    timeline: "Week -7 to Week -6"
    success_criteria:
      - "≥80% complete Scenario 1 (Upload) without help"
      - "≥70% complete Scenario 2 (MCP Query) successfully within reasonable time"
      - "≥65% successfully ask cross-document questions (Scenario 3)"
      - "≥70% navigate to timeline (Scenario 4) without prompting"
      - "≥70% understand that uploaded data becomes queryable via AI"
      - "System Usability Scale (SUS) score ≥70"
      - "≤2 critical usability blockers identified"

  business_viability_discovery:
    hypothesis: "AI-Native Individual Operators will pay €25-€125/month for MVP to give Claude/ChatGPT access to their personal data via MCP"
    method: "Willingness-to-pay interviews (live, Mom Test methodology)"
    participants:
      - segment: "AI-Native Individual Operators"
        count: 8
    timeline: "Week -6 to Week -5"
    success_criteria:
      - "≥50% express willingness to pay ≥€25/month (based on past purchasing behavior)"
      - "≥30% express willingness to pay ≥€50/month"
      - "Optimal price point (PSM intersection) within €25-€125 range"
      - "≥60% prefer monthly subscription over one-time"
      - "Clear value drivers for paying identified (time saved, new workflows enabled)"
      - "Past purchasing behavior aligns with target price point"

  feasibility_validation:
    hypothesis: "OCR determinism is achievable with pinned tesseract version and explicit low-confidence handling"
    method: "Technical proof of concept (no participants needed)"
    timeline: "Week -8 to Week -7"
    success_criteria:
      - "100% OCR output reproducibility on test corpus (20+ documents, 100 runs each)"
      - "Low-confidence flagging accuracy ≥85%"
      - "Extraction determinism verified on representative documents"
      - "Schema detection accuracy >85%"
      - "Performance targets met (<5s P95 upload latency, <500ms P95 MCP query latency)"
