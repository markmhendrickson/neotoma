### 1. Hypothesis and Assumptions

**Hypothesis:** "AI-Native Individual Operators will pay €25-€125/month for MVP to give Claude/ChatGPT access to their personal data via MCP"

**Assumptions:**
- Tier 1 ICP values AI-native personal data access enough to pay
- MCP access is a key differentiator justifying premium pricing
- Monthly subscription is preferred over one-time payment
- €25-€125 range aligns with perceived value of AI-native workflow
- Problem + solution validated before testing pricing

---

### 2. Discovery Method

**Method**: Willingness-to-pay interviews (live, Mom Test methodology)

**Why Live Required:**
- Must probe past purchasing behavior: "Tell me about tools you've purchased..." requires follow-up
- Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter: Requires conversation to contextualize price responses
- Detect commitment signals: Budget allocation, switching costs need conversation to validate
- Understand value drivers: "What would make you pay?" requires probing to understand true drivers
- Avoid false positives: People overstate willingness to pay on surveys

---

### 3. Participants

- **Segment**: AI-Native Individual Operators
- **Count**: 8 participants
- **Recruitment**: Subset from value discovery participants (those expressing high interest AND commitment signals AND actual AI usage patterns)

---

### 4. Precondition

**Only conduct pricing interviews AFTER problem validated (AI lacks personal data access) AND solution addresses it (MCP solves workflow)**

---

### 5. Interview Structure

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes per interview

#### Section 1: Past Purchasing Behavior (Start Here)

**Goal**: Understand past behavior related to AI tools and productivity tools, not hypothetical willingness to pay

**Questions:**

1. "Tell me about tools you've purchased to improve how you work with AI or access your data."
   - Follow-ups:
     - What tools did you buy? (AI tools, data access tools, productivity tools)
     - What did you pay for them?
     - What made you decide to pay?
     - Are you still using them? Why or why not?

2. "What tools have you tried for giving AI access to your data but didn't pay for? Why didn't you pay?"
   - Follow-ups:
     - What was missing?
     - What would have made you pay?
     - What price would have changed your mind?

3. "Walk me through your current productivity and AI tool stack."
   - Follow-ups:
     - What AI tools do you pay for? (Claude Pro, ChatGPT Plus, etc.)
     - What productivity tools do you pay for?
     - What do you pay for each?
     - How do you decide what's worth paying for?
     - What's your monthly budget for productivity and AI tools?

---

#### Section 2: Willingness to Pay (Based on Past Behavior)

**Questions:**

1. "If this gave Claude/ChatGPT access to your personal data via MCP and solved [validated problem - preparing data manually], how would you decide whether to pay for it?"
   - Follow-ups:
     - What would need to be true?
     - What features would be must-have?
     - How would you justify the cost?
     - How much time/money would this need to save you?

2. "Tell me about tools similar to this that you've evaluated — tools that connect AI to your data."
   - Follow-ups:
     - What did you look at?
     - What did they cost?
     - Why didn't you buy them? (or why did you?)

3. "If this existed today at [price point], would you switch from your current workaround (copy-paste, manual prep)?"
   - Follow-ups:
     - What would make you switch?
     - What would prevent you from switching?
     - How long would you evaluate before deciding?

---

#### Section 3: Price Sensitivity (Van Westendorp with Past Behavior Context)

**Approach**: Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter with past behavior context

**Questions:**

1. "Given that you pay €X for [similar tool - Claude Pro, ChatGPT Plus, productivity tools], at what price would this be so expensive you wouldn't consider it?"

2. "At what price would you consider it expensive but still consider buying?"

3. "At what price would you consider it a bargain?"

4. "At what price would it be so cheap you'd question the quality?"

**Price Anchoring:**
- For context: Claude Pro is $20/mo, ChatGPT Plus is $20/mo, productivity tools range from €10-€100/mo
- MVP features: Upload documents, deterministic extraction, MCP access to Claude/ChatGPT, timeline view
- Value: Save time preparing data for AI, enable new AI-native workflows

---

#### Section 4: Commitment Signals

**Questions:**
- "What would make you cancel or stop using this?"
- "Deal-breakers"
- "What would make you switch to a competitor?"
- "What problems would cause you to leave?"

**Look For:**
- Past purchasing behavior (actual subscriptions, not hypothetical)
- Budget allocation (where they currently spend money)
- Switching costs (from current workarounds)
- Commitment signals (actual purchases, not hypothetical interest)

---

### 6. Mom Test Principles

**Methodology**: The Mom Test (https://www.momtestbook.com)

**Question Framing**: Focus on past purchasing behavior for AI tools and productivity tools, not hypothetical willingness to pay

**Commitment Signals:**
- Past purchases of AI tools (Claude Pro, ChatGPT Plus)
- Past purchases of productivity/data access tools
- Budget allocation for AI and productivity tools
- Switching costs from current workarounds (time, money)
- Price sensitivity based on past behavior

**Red Flags:**
- Hypothetical interest without past purchasing evidence
- Vague enthusiasm about pricing without commitment
- Agreement without past behavior context
- No actual paid tool usage

---

### 7. Success Criteria

- ≥50% express willingness to pay ≥€25/month (based on past purchasing behavior)
- ≥30% express willingness to pay ≥€50/month
- Optimal price point (PSM intersection) within €25-€125 range
- ≥60% prefer monthly subscription over one-time
- Clear value drivers for paying identified (time saved, new workflows enabled)
- Past purchasing behavior aligns with target price point

---

### 8. Timeline

**Timeline**: Week -6 to Week -5

**Schedule:**
- Week -6: Schedule participants (subset from value discovery), prepare interview guide
- Week -6 to -5: Conduct pricing interviews (8 participants)
- Week -5: Synthesize findings, calculate PSM optimal price point

---

### 9. Deliverable
