### Outreach Templates

```
Hi [Name], 

I'm building a tool that helps AI-native operators give Claude/ChatGPT access to their personal data. I'd love to learn about how you currently work with AI tools and personal data.

Would you be open to a 30-45 min chat? I'm not selling anything — just trying to understand the problem better.

Thanks!

Happy to schedule at your convenience.

Thanks,
