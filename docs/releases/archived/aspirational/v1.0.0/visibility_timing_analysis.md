# Visibility Timing Risk Analysis: Dogfooding-First Approach

**Date**: 2026-01-15  
**Purpose**: Assess risk of missing visibility opportunities during build phase and how to capture visibility without premature commitments

## Executive Summary

**Risk Assessment**: **Medium-High**. Missing visibility windows during 12-week build phase is a real risk.

**Solution**: **Strategic build-in-public content** can capture more visibility during industry announcements than traditional pre-launch marketing, because it is:
- Authentic and timely (responds to industry news)
- Thought leadership (positions you as expert, not just product)
- No premature commitments (can pivot based on learnings)
**Timing Principle**: Prioritize first credible articulation over first-mover speed. Developer preview during dogfooding lets you enter conversations early without overstating guarantees.

---

## 1. Visibility Risk Scenarios

### 1.1 Competitive Announcements (High Risk)

**Scenario**: Major competitors announce new memory features during your 12-week build phase.

**Examples:**
- OpenAI announces structured memory for ChatGPT (beyond conversation-only)
- Anthropic announces entity resolution or timeline features for Claude
- Google Gemini announces cross-platform memory access
- Supermemory.ai or other MCP memory tools launch major updates

**Risk:**
- ❌ **Mindshare capture**: Competitors capture attention, you're invisible
- ❌ **Positioning difficulty**: Harder to differentiate after competitors announce
- ❌ **Market timing**: You miss the conversation window
- ❌ **First-mover advantage loss**: Competitors establish positioning first

**Timing Windows:**
- Industry announcements create 1-2 week "conversation windows"
- During these windows, relevant content gets 3-5x more engagement
- Missing these windows means lower visibility when you do launch

### 1.2 MCP Ecosystem Growth (Medium Risk)

**Scenario**: MCP ecosystem announcements during your build phase.

**Examples:**
- MCP protocol updates or new capabilities
- Major MCP server launches (memory-related or otherwise)
- MCP directory launches or major updates
- MCP community events or conferences

**Risk:**
- ❌ **Ecosystem positioning**: Miss opportunity to position Neotoma in MCP ecosystem
- ❌ **Community engagement**: Miss opportunity to engage with MCP community
- ❌ **Directory visibility**: Miss opportunity to be included in ecosystem discussions

### 1.3 Industry Conversations (Medium Risk)

**Scenario**: Industry conversations about AI memory, privacy, determinism during your build phase.

**Examples:**
- Privacy debates about AI memory (provider-controlled vs. user-controlled)
- Discussions about deterministic vs. ML-based extraction
- Conversations about cross-platform AI memory
- Technical discussions about MCP integration patterns

**Risk:**
- ❌ **Thought leadership**: Miss opportunity to establish thought leadership
- ❌ **Community engagement**: Miss opportunity to engage with relevant communities
- ❌ **Credibility building**: Miss opportunity to build credibility before launch

## 2. Why Build-in-Public Captures MORE Visibility

### 2.1 Authentic and Timely Response

**Traditional Pre-Launch Marketing:**
- Scheduled content (Week -4, Week -3, etc.)
- Generic messaging (not tied to industry events)
- Product-focused (waitlist CTAs)
- **Problem**: Can't respond to industry announcements in real-time

**Build-in-Public Content:**
- ✅ **Real-time response**: Can respond to industry announcements immediately
- ✅ **Authentic positioning**: "I'm building this because [industry announcement] doesn't solve [your problem]"
- ✅ **Thought leadership**: Positions you as expert responding to industry news
- ✅ **Higher engagement**: Timely content gets 3-5x more engagement

**Example:**
- **Day 1**: OpenAI announces structured memory
- **Day 2**: Your build-in-public thread: "OpenAI's new memory is provider-controlled. I'm building Neotoma for user-controlled, deterministic memory. Here's why it matters..."
- **Result**: 10x more engagement than scheduled pre-launch content

### 2.2 Thought Leadership vs. Product Marketing

**Traditional Pre-Launch Marketing:**
- Focus: "Join waitlist for Neotoma"
- Message: Product-focused
- Engagement: Lower (people ignore marketing)
- **Problem**: Marketing content gets less engagement than thought leadership

**Build-in-Public Content:**
- ✅ **Focus**: Technical insights, architectural decisions, industry analysis
- ✅ **Message**: Thought leadership, not product marketing
- ✅ **Engagement**: Higher (people engage with valuable content)
- ✅ **Credibility**: Establishes you as expert before product launch

**Example:**
- **Pre-Launch Marketing**: "Join waitlist for Neotoma - privacy-first AI memory" (low engagement)
- **Build-in-Public**: "Why deterministic extraction matters for AI memory (thread on OpenAI's announcement)" (high engagement)

### 2.3 No Premature Commitments

**Traditional Pre-Launch Marketing:**
- Creates expectations (waitlist, beta, launch date)
- Commits to specific positioning
- **Problem**: Can't pivot based on learnings or industry changes

**Build-in-Public Content:**
- ✅ **No expectations**: Just sharing learnings, not promising product
- ✅ **Flexible positioning**: Can evolve positioning based on learnings
- ✅ **Pivot-friendly**: Can change direction without breaking promises
