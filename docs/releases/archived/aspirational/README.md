# Archived Aspirational Releases

These releases were planned but did not represent actual implementation. They have been archived as part of the v0.3.0 reconciliation release (2025-02-05) to establish an accurate baseline between documented releases and actual codebase state.

## Archived Releases

| Release | Original Purpose | Status | Archived Date |
|---------|------------------|--------|---------------|
| v0.4.0 | Intelligence + Housekeeping | Planning | 2025-02-05 |
| v0.5.0 | Agent Cryptographic Signing | Planning | 2025-02-05 |
| v0.9.0 | MCP Support System | Planning | 2025-02-05 |
| v1.0.0 | MVP | Planning | 2025-02-05 |
| v2.0.0 | End-to-End Encryption | Planning | 2025-02-05 |
| v2.1.0 | GDPR & US State Privacy Compliance | Planning | 2025-02-05 |
| v2.2.0 | HNSW Vector Search Optimization | Planning | 2025-02-05 |

## Why Archived

During late 2024 and early 2025, significant development work occurred outside the formal release process. This created a gap between documented releases (which included many aspirational "planning" releases) and actual implementation.

These releases were never implemented and do not reflect the actual state of the codebase. They remain here for historical reference and can be revisited for future planning.

## What Happened Instead

The actual implemented features during this period included:
- Schema registry system
- Sources-first architecture with observations
- Entity system with resolution
- Auto-enhancement system
- MCP OAuth integration
- Frontend development
- CLI development
- Foundation submodule integration
- Comprehensive documentation

These implementations were documented in the v0.3.0 reconciliation release.

## Going Forward

Future releases will be planned realistically based on the v0.3.0 baseline (which accurately documents current implementation). The release process will follow proper Feature Unit workflow to prevent this type of drift.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Release discipline matters** - Even in solo/rapid development, tracking prevents drift
2. **Document as you go** - Retroactive documentation is harder and less accurate
3. **Aspirational releases can mislead** - Planning too far ahead without implementation creates confusion
4. **Feature Unit workflow prevents drift** - When followed consistently

## References

- [v0.3.0 Reconciliation Release](../../v0.3.0/release_plan.md) - Documents actual current state
- [v0.2.15 Release](../../v0.2.15/status.md) - Last documented implemented release before reconciliation
- [Release Workflow](../../../developer/release_workflow.md) - Proper release process going forward

**Note:** These archived releases remain available for reference and for mining ideas for future planning, but they should not be considered as reflecting actual implementation history.
