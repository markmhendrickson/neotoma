purpose: |
  Reconciliation release documenting actual current state of codebase after period of 
  untracked development. Establishes clean baseline for future release planning.

scope:
  - Document actual implemented features
  - Archive aspirational releases
  - Create accurate baseline for future planning
  - Acknowledge technical debt

actual_implementation:

  - Sources-first architecture
  - Observations architecture
  - Entity system with resolution
  - Auto-enhancement system
  - MCP integration with OAuth
  - React frontend with design system

  - v2.0.0
  - v2.1.0
  - v2.2.0

technical_debt:
  - Feature Unit tracking incomplete
  - Test coverage needs audit
  - Documentation sync needed
  - Migration state verification needed
  - 262 uncommitted changes to review

next_steps:
  immediate:
    - Review and commit/clean uncommitted changes
    - Apply pending migrations
    - Audit test suite
    - Update documentation accuracy
  near_term:
    - Plan v0.4.0 realistically based on v0.3.0 baseline
    - Establish release discipline
    - Prioritize technical debt

lessons_learned:
  - Release discipline is critical even in rapid development
  - Commit early and often (avoid large uncommitted changesets)
  - Documentation as you go is easier than retroactive
  - Feature Unit workflow prevents drift when followed
