# v0.2.3 Release Overview

## Descriptive Summary

Release v0.2.3 extends Neotoma's schema to support foundation agent memory, enabling AI agents to store and query codebase metadata alongside real-world entities in a unified memory system. This release addresses a critical gap in agent memory management: foundation agents currently use lightweight `.cursor/memory/` directories for codebase metadata, creating fragmented memory that doesn't persist across sessions or benefit from entity resolution. v0.2.3 solves this by adding seven new entity types—feature_unit, release, agent_decision, agent_session, validation_result, codebase_entity, and architectural_decision—that integrate seamlessly with Neotoma's existing entity resolution, timeline generation, and cross-session persistence capabilities. The release implements [Agent Skills for Context Engineering](https://github.com/muratcankoylan/Agent-Skills-for-Context-Engineering) principles, achieving 9.5/10 alignment with the framework's memory systems, context compression, context degradation management, and evaluation patterns.

The technical implementation centers on seven new MCP (Model Context Protocol) actions that enable agents to store and query codebase metadata: `submit_feature_unit`, `submit_release`, `submit_agent_decision`, `submit_agent_session`, `query_codebase_entities`, `query_agent_history`, and `query_entity_timeline`. Each action follows Agent Skills tool design principles with clear input/output schemas, comprehensive error handling, validation at the ingestion boundary, and graceful degradation to local memory when Neotoma is unavailable. The schema extensions use direct property assignment for agent-created data, ensuring deterministic storage and full provenance tracking. Entity resolution automatically deduplicates entities across sessions (e.g., "Feature Unit FU-061" resolves to a single entity regardless of which agent or session created it), while timeline queries enable agents to understand development history and make informed decisions based on past work.

v0.2.3 provides significant context engineering benefits that directly address Agent Skills principles. The release implements query-based memory that prevents "lost-in-the-middle" degradation by allowing agents to load only relevant entities instead of entire memory into the context window, achieving up to 100:1 compression ratios through entity resolution (3:1), snapshot compression (5:1), timeline summarization (20:1), selective loading (92:1), and checkpoint restoration (25:1). The documentation explicitly covers all five context degradation types—lost-in-the-middle, U-shaped attention curves, attention scarcity, context poisoning, and context distraction—with prevention strategies for each. Context optimization patterns enable agents to curate high-signal tokens through progressive disclosure (load foundation → specific → related), filtered queries, and context budget management (20% foundation, 30% related, 40% task, 10% reserve). This approach transforms agent memory from a context-window burden into an external, queryable resource that scales without degrading performance.

The release enables sophisticated multi-agent collaboration patterns that were previously impossible with fragmented memory. Three primary patterns are documented: orchestrator (supervisor delegates tasks to specialists), peer-to-peer (agents collaborate as equals and share discoveries), and hierarchical (multi-tier organization with supervisor, managers, and workers). Agents coordinate through shared Neotoma memory, querying task queues, building consensus on decisions, broadcasting status updates, and resolving conflicts when multiple agents update the same entity. The evaluation patterns provide comprehensive agent performance tracking through task completion rates, validation pass rates, session success metrics, quality scoring (Feature Unit quality, release readiness), benchmark tasks (completion time, decision quality), and historical trend analysis. Advanced evaluation techniques include pairwise comparison with position bias mitigation, rubric generation from historical data, multi-criteria weighted evaluation, and LLM-as-judge patterns that evaluate agent decisions against quality criteria.

v0.2.3 represents a production-ready implementation of Agent Skills for Context Engineering principles, achieving 9.5/10 alignment across all ten skills. The release includes comprehensive documentation: a 18 KB release specification, seven detailed schema extension documents (10-12 KB each), complete MCP action documentation (22 KB), a migration guide with executable TypeScript scripts (23 KB), and an integration guide with 66+ code examples covering memory storage, retrieval, context management, multi-agent patterns, and evaluation techniques (24 KB). The documentation provides graceful degradation patterns, best practices, performance considerations, and testing examples that enable foundation agents to immediately adopt Neotoma for unified memory management. With this release, foundation agents can transition from fragmented `.cursor/memory/` directories to a unified, queryable memory system that supports cross-session persistence, entity resolution, timeline generation, and comprehensive evaluation—all while preventing context degradation and achieving significant context compression.
