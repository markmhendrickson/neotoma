# Plan format rules
## Scope
This document defines required content for all plans created or updated by agents. It does not define implementation details for any feature or subsystem.

## Purpose
Ensure every plan includes the key problems solved and key solutions implemented.

## Trigger Patterns
When an agent creates or updates a plan, the plan MUST include key problems solved and key solutions implemented.

## Agent Actions
### Step 1: Include key problems solved
1. Add a section titled "Key problems solved".
2. List the main problems the plan addresses.

### Step 2: Include key solutions implemented
1. Add a section titled "Key solutions implemented".
2. List the main solutions the plan will implement.

## Constraints
- Agents MUST include the sections "Key problems solved" and "Key solutions implemented" in every plan.
- Agents MUST list at least one item in each of these sections.
- Agents MUST use direct, declarative language.
