# Repository Cleanup and Reorganization Plan

## Issues Identified

### 1. Outdated Documentation Files

- **CLAUDE.md** (root): Outdated documentation referencing old "objects" table architecture instead of current "records" table. Mentions deprecated architecture.
- **SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md** (root): Duplicates content from `docs/developer/getting_started.md` and contains outdated references to "objects" table.

### 2. Build Artifacts Committed

- **public/assets/main-*.js** and **public/assets/main-*.css**: Build artifacts from Vite that should not be committed to git. These are generated files.

### 3. System Files Committed

- **.DS_Store** files: macOS system files committed in root and docs/ directories. Already in .gitignore but files exist.
- **neotoma.code-workspace**: VS Code workspace file committed. Already in .gitignore but file exists.

### 4. Script Documentation Organization

- **scripts/README_RELEASE_ORCHESTRATOR.md**: Documentation file in scripts directory. Should be moved to `docs/developer/` or `docs/feature_units/standards/`.
- **scripts/worker_agent_template.md**: Template file in scripts directory. Should be moved to `docs/feature_units/standards/` or `docs/developer/`.

## Proposed Changes

### Phase 1: Remove Outdated Documentation

1. **Delete CLAUDE.md** - Outdated and references wrong architecture
2. **Delete SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Superseded by `docs/developer/getting_started.md`

### Phase 2: Remove Build Artifacts

1. **Remove public/assets/** directory from git tracking

- Add `public/assets/` to `.gitignore` if not already present
- Remove committed build artifacts: `public/assets/main-*.js` and `public/assets/main-*.css`

### Phase 3: Clean System Files

1. **Remove .DS_Store files** from git tracking

- Already in `.gitignore`, but remove existing committed files

2. **Remove neotoma.code-workspace** from git tracking

- Already in `.gitignore`, but remove existing committed file

### Phase 4: Reorganize Script Documentation

1. **Move scripts/README_RELEASE_ORCHESTRATOR.md** → `docs/developer/release_orchestrator.md`
2. **Move scripts/worker_agent_template.md** → `docs/feature_units/standards/worker_agent_template.md`
3. Update any references to these files in:

- `docs/feature_units/standards/multi_agent_orchestration.md`
- `scripts/release_orchestrator.js` (if it references the README)
- Any other documentation that references these files

### Phase 5: Verify .gitignore

1. Ensure `.gitignore` includes:

- `public/assets/` (build artifacts)
- `.DS_Store` (already present)
- `*.code-workspace` (already present)
- `dist/` (already present)

## Files to Modify

### Delete

- `CLAUDE.md`
- `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- `public/assets/main-Byj9Aczh.css` (from git)
- `public/assets/main-CNxY3Wx_.js` (from git)
- `.DS_Store` (from git, multiple locations)
- `neotoma.code-workspace` (from git)

### Move

- `scripts/README_RELEASE_ORCHESTRATOR.md` → `docs/developer/release_orchestrator.md`
- `scripts/worker_agent_template.md` → `docs/feature_units/standards/worker_agent_template.md`

### Update

- `.gitignore` - Add `public/assets/` if not present
- Any documentation files that reference moved files

## Verification Steps

1. Run `git status` to verify files are untracked/removed
2. Verify `.gitignore` properly excludes build artifacts
3. Check that moved documentation files are accessible in new locations
4. Verify no broken references exist after moves
5. Confirm build still works (artifacts regenerate in public/assets/)

## Notes

- Build artifacts in `public/assets/` should be regenerated by running the build process, not committed
- The `public/` directory structure should remain, but `public/assets/` contents should be gitignored
- Script documentation belongs in docs/ rather than scripts/ directory for better discoverability
