# Why Neotoma Exists: The Problem

_(The Problem Neotoma Solves)_

---

## Purpose

This document explains the fundamental problems Neotoma addresses in the AI-native personal computing landscape.

---

## 6.1 Personal Data is Fragmented

Users store critical documents across:

- Email attachments (Gmail, Outlook)
- Downloads folders (PDFs, images)
- WhatsApp/iMessage screenshots
- Cloud drives (Dropbox, Google Drive)
- Desktop files, phone photos
- App exports (bank statements, receipts)
- Scanner outputs

**No system unifies this into durable, structured memory.**

---

## 6.2 AI Has No Memory

LLMs cannot reason across:

- Multi-session memory (forgets after chat ends)
- Long-horizon life context (no continuity)
- Cross-document relationships (can't link entities)
- Identity continuity (doesn't know "Acme Corp" = "ACME CORP")
- Events over time (can't build timelines)

**Every AI interaction starts from zero.**

---

## 6.3 Neotoma Provides the Missing Substrate

Neotoma gives AI:

- Stable record IDs (persistent references)
- Stable entity IDs (canonical representations)
- Stable event/timeline structures (temporal reasoning)
- Correct retrieval (deterministic search)
- Explicit provenance (trust and auditability)

**Neotoma is the "RAM + HDD" for AI-native personal computing.**
