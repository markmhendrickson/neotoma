# Empty States

## Empty State Style

**Minimal Approach:**

- No illustrations (per brand constraints)
- Clear message text
- Action button (primary)
- Helpful secondary text

**Example:**

```
"No sources yet"
"Upload your first document to get started"
[Upload Document Button]
```

## Empty State Variants

**No Sources:**

- Message: "No sources yet"
- CTA: "Upload your first document"
- Secondary: "Drag and drop files or click to browse"

**No Search Results:**

- Message: "No matches found"
- Secondary: "Try different search terms or filters"
- Clear filters button

**No Entities:**

- Message: "Entities will appear after upload"
- Secondary: "Upload documents to see people, companies, and locations"

**No Events:**

- Message: "Events will appear from dates in documents"
- Secondary: "Upload documents with dates to build your timeline"
