# Neotoma Internal MCP Release — Specification

_(MCP-Focused, Single-User Release for Internal Validation)_

---

## Purpose

This document defines the scope for an **internal, MCP-only release** that precedes the full MVP. This release enables internal validation of Neotoma's core capabilities via MCP integration with Cursor and ChatGPT, without requiring UI components or multi-user infrastructure.

**Release Goal:** Validate deterministic ingestion, extraction, entity resolution, event generation, and graph construction through MCP-only access.

## Validation Workflows

**1. File Upload → Extraction → Query**

```
Cursor/ChatGPT → upload_file("invoice.pdf")
  → File analyzed, fields extracted
  → Entities resolved, events generated
  → Graph inserted
  → retrieve_records(type="invoice")
  → Verify extracted fields, entities, events
```

**2. Manual Record Creation → Query**

```
Cursor/ChatGPT → store_record({
  type: "invoice",
  properties: { invoice_number: "INV-001", amount: 1000 }
})
  → retrieve_records(type="invoice")
  → Verify record stored correctly
```

**3. Entity Resolution Validation**

```
Cursor/ChatGPT → upload_file("invoice1.pdf") // Contains "Acme Corp"
  → upload_file("invoice2.pdf") // Contains "ACME CORP"
  → retrieve_records(type="invoice")
  → Verify both records link to same entity ID
```

**4. Timeline Event Validation**

```
Cursor/ChatGPT → upload_file("invoice.pdf") // Contains date_issued: "2024-01-15"
  → retrieve_records(type="invoice")
  → Verify event generated with correct timestamp
  → Query events chronologically
```

**5. Search and Filtering**

```
Cursor/ChatGPT → retrieve_records({
  type: "invoice",
  properties: { vendor: "Acme Corp" },
  search: ["invoice"],
  limit: 10
})
  → Verify deterministic ordering
  → Verify filters applied correctly
```
