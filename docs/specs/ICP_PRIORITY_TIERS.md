# Neotoma ICP Priority Tiers
## Grouped by Addressability, Revenue Potential, and Early GTM Fit
**For detailed ICP profiles (pain points, use cases, workflows), see [`docs/specs/ICP_PROFILES.md`](./ICP_PROFILES.md).**
# TIER 1 — Early Revenue, Highest Intent, Fastest Adoption
(Neotoma MVP MUST directly serve these ICPs)
These ICPs require no multi-user features, no enterprise controls, no deep integrations.  
They experience immediate pain from fragmented truth and are willing to pay now.  
They also naturally become bottom-up champions for B2B adoption.
### Included ICPs
- **AI-Native Individual Operators**  
  Heavy ChatGPT/Claude/Raycast/Cursor users; strongest personal pain; immediate activation.  
- **High-Context Knowledge Workers**  
  Analysts, researchers, consultants, lawyers; high document load; rely on cross-document reasoning.  
- **AI-Native Founders & Small Teams (2–20 people)**  
  Will initially adopt individually, then expand into team usage organically.  
  They bridge B2C → B2B expansion.  
### Why Tier 1
- Lowest activation friction  
- Highest willingness to pay early  
- Strongest retention and daily use  
- They validate ingestion, schema, events, and MCP  
- They pull Neotoma into larger organizations through bottom-up demand  
# TIER 2 — Early B2B Expansion (High Revenue Leverage, Medium Activation Friction)
After Tier 1 proves the product and memory substrate, these ICPs represent the next wave of revenue expansion.  
They require some multi-user features and stronger organizational semantics—but still adopt relatively early.
### Included ICPs
- **Hybrid Product Teams (PM + Eng + Design + Marketing)**  
  Coordination breakdown is significant; many AI tools in use; high ROI.  
- **Cross-Functional Operational Teams (Ops, RevOps, Marketing Ops)**  
  Rely heavily on content + workflows + repetitive AI tasks; crave consistency.  
- **Developer Integrators**  
  Build internal tools, automations, and agent systems; require stable truth APIs.  
- **AI Tool Integrators (Cursor, Raycast, VSCode, Claude Tools)**  
  Integrate Neotoma to provide persistent memory across tools.
### Why Tier 2
- Medium friction, but high upside  
- Bigger seats and higher ACVs ($2–20k ARR per team)  
- Require multi-agent alignment, versioned truth, and shared memory  
- Benefit enormously from the Organizational Memory substrate  
# TIER 3 — B2C Power Users (High Value, Lower ARPU, Slower GTM)  
These ICPs get strong value from Neotoma but are **not ideal initial revenue drivers**.  
They will convert gradually through inbound, bottom-up adoption.
### Included ICPs
- **Cross-Border Solopreneurs**  
  High document entropy; rely heavily on receipts, invoicing, travel.  
- **Multi-System Information Workers**  
  Benefit from unification, but require education.  
- **High-Entropy Households / Family Managers**  
  Strong personal need, but slow adoption curve.
### Why Tier 3
- Good long-term base  
- Lower ARPU  
- Higher support/education requirements  
- Conversion dependent on trust built through Tier 1 success  
# TIER 4 — Strategy-Layer ICPs (Agentic Portfolio)  
(Requires later product maturity and asset/tax modeling stack)
These ICPs rely on structured truth but need **Agentic Portfolio** capabilities built on top of Neotoma.  
They are **not** early targets for MVP revenue.
### Included ICPs
- **High-Net-Worth Individuals**  
- **Multi-Jurisdiction Residents**  
- **Crypto-Native Power Users (staking, LPs, vaults)**  
- **Startup Founders with Equity Docs**  
- **Family-Office-Lite Users**
### Why Tier 4
- High future ACV  
- Complex requirements (risk, tax, multi-asset planning)  
- Requires a mature truth layer + strategy engine  
# TIER 5 — Execution-Layer ICPs (Agentic Wallet)  
(Last to pursue; dependent on Agentic Portfolio + chain execution layer)
### Included ICPs
- **High-Frequency On-Chain Actors**  
- **Agent-Compatible Crypto Users**  
- **Protocol Explorers**  
- **Bitcoin/Stacks Ecosystem Power Users**
### Why Tier 5
- Requires on-chain execution, safety systems, transaction simulation  
- High regulatory and technical burden  
- Must come after organizational expansion  
# TIER 6 — Enterprise AI Deployments (Future)  
(Only when Neotoma supports full org-wide agent orchestration)
### Included ICPs
- **Mid-market + enterprise teams (200–10,000 employees)**  
- **Companies deploying dozens of internal AI agents**  
- **Organizations requiring AI governance + auditability**
### Why Tier 6
- Highest ACV and long-term potential  
- Highest product complexity  
- Requires advanced permissions, multi-user governance, agent orchestration, and full organizational memory architecture  
- Must be built after Neotoma is proven across many smaller teams  
# Final Tier Summary (Prioritized for GTM)
### **Tier 1 — Immediate Activation + Early Revenue**  
- AI-Native Individuals  
- High-Context Knowledge Workers  
- AI-Native Small Teams (individual → team expansion)
### **Tier 2 — Early B2B Expansion**  
- Hybrid Product Teams  
- Ops Teams  
- Developer + AI Tool Integrators
### **Tier 3 — B2C Power Users (Long-Term Organic Growth)**  
- Cross-Border Solopreneurs  
- Multi-System Workers  
- Households
### **Tier 4 — Strategy-Layer (Agentic Portfolio)**  
- HNW, Multi-Jurisdiction, Equity-Heavy Founders, Crypto Power Users
### **Tier 5 — Execution-Layer (Agentic Wallet)**  
- On-chain operators, agent-compatible users, protocol explorers
### **Tier 6 — Enterprise Deployments**  
- org-wide AI memory substrate customers
# One-Line GTM Summary
**Start with AI-native individuals → expand to small AI-native teams → land hybrid product orgs → grow into strategy/execution layers → end in enterprise memory adoption.**
## Agent Instructions
### When to Load This Document
Load when:
- Planning GTM strategy or product roadmap
- Prioritizing feature development
- Making decisions about multi-user features vs single-user focus
- Understanding which ICPs require which product layers (Truth vs Strategy vs Execution)
### Required Co-Loaded Documents
- `docs/NEOTOMA_MANIFEST.md` (always)
- `docs/specs/MVP_OVERVIEW.md` (for MVP scope alignment)
- `docs/specs/ICP_PROFILES.md` (for detailed ICP profiles)
### Constraints Agents Must Enforce
1. MVP MUST directly serve Tier 1 ICPs
2. Tier 2+ features require explicit product maturity milestones
3. Tier 4+ ICPs require Agentic Portfolio/Wallet layers (not Neotoma MVP scope)
4. All product decisions must align with tier prioritization
### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Feature serves Tier 1 ICPs (MVP requirement)
- [ ] Tier 2+ features clearly marked as post-MVP
- [ ] Strategy/Execution layer features correctly attributed to Agentic Portfolio/Wallet
- [ ] GTM roadmap follows tier progression
