### A-ha Moment
The moment when they ask an AI tool a question about a document they uploaded weeks ago, and the AI answers correctly using that document's context—without them having to re-upload or re-explain anything. They realize their AI tools now have persistent memory.
### Ready-to-Pay Threshold
After successfully querying 3-5 documents via AI and seeing cross-document synthesis work (e.g., "Summarize all contracts involving Acme Corp" pulls from multiple documents). They've experienced the value and are willing to pay to maintain this capability.
### Adoption Characteristics
- **Activation:** Immediate (understand value proposition instantly)
- **Willingness to pay:** High (already paying for AI tools)
- **Retention:** Strong (daily use, core workflow dependency)
- **Expansion:** Natural champions for team adoption
### Pricing Sensitivity & Price Points
- **Current spend:** $20-50/month on AI tools (ChatGPT Plus $20, Claude Pro $20, Cursor $20)
- **Price sensitivity:** Low (already paying for tools, understand value of productivity tools)
- **Acceptable range:** $10-30/month for individual, $50-200/month for team
- **Value anchor:** Compares to AI tool subscriptions, not document storage tools
- **Payment method:** Credit card, comfortable with subscription model
### Competitive Alternatives
- **Current solutions:** Manual document organization (Google Drive, Dropbox), no AI memory solution
- **Workarounds:** Re-uploading documents to AI tools, copying context between sessions, using multiple AI tools
- **Why they'd switch:** No current solution provides persistent AI memory; workarounds are time-consuming
- **Switching barriers:** Low (no existing tool to migrate from, just adding new capability)
### Sales Cycle & Decision Process
- **Sales cycle:** 0-7 days (self-serve, no sales team needed)
- **Decision maker:** Individual (no approval needed)
- **Decision process:** Try → see value → pay (typical freemium model)
- **Touchpoints:** Product Hunt launch, community posts, tool integration discovery
- **Sales model:** Self-serve with optional support
### Key Objections
- **"Another tool to manage"** → Emphasize MCP integration (works with existing tools)
- **"Will it work with my AI tools?"** → Show MCP integration, compatibility matrix
- **"How is this different from [tool]?"** → Emphasize AI memory vs file storage
- **"Privacy concerns"** → Clear privacy policy, encryption, RLS, data residency options
- **"Setup complexity"** → One-click MCP setup, quick start guide, sample data
### Buying Signals
- **Strong signals:** Active ChatGPT Plus/Claude Pro subscriber, posts about AI tool limitations, mentions "AI memory" or "context loss"

### A-ha Moment
When multiple AI agents across different departments successfully coordinate using shared Neotoma memory, and a query from one agent leverages context from another agent's work. They realize organizational memory is working at scale.
### Ready-to-Pay Threshold
After successfully deploying 5-10 AI agents with shared memory and seeing measurable improvements (time savings, consistency, knowledge preservation). They've proven organizational memory value and are ready for enterprise ACV (requires full organizational memory architecture).
### Pricing Sensitivity & Price Points
- **Current spend:** $50000-500000/year on enterprise tools, AI infrastructure, knowledge management
- **Price sensitivity:** Low (enterprise expense, values organizational memory)
- **Acceptable range:** $50000-200000/year for mid-market, $200000-1000000/year for enterprise
- **Value anchor:** Compares to enterprise knowledge management, AI infrastructure, organizational efficiency value
- **Payment method:** Enterprise contracts, PO process, annual billing
### Competitive Alternatives
- **Current solutions:** Enterprise knowledge management, AI infrastructure, no organizational memory solution
- **Workarounds:** Manual knowledge management, agent-specific memory, no shared organizational memory
- **Why they'd switch:** No current solution provides organizational memory for agents; knowledge fragmentation is painful
- **Switching barriers:** Very high (requires full organizational memory architecture, enterprise trust, migration complexity)
