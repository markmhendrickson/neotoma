## 2. Service Description

### 2.1 What Neotoma Does

Neotoma is a **deterministic, structured memory substrate** that transforms fragmented personal data into AI-ready knowledge via dual-path ingestion. Neotoma:

- Accepts personal data via dual-path ingestion:
  - File uploads (PDFs, images)
  - Agent interactions (structured data via MCP `store_record`)
- Extracts structured fields (invoice numbers, amounts, dates, etc.) from documents OR accepts structured data from agents
- Identifies entities (people, companies, locations) across all personal data
- Builds timelines from dates across all personal data
- Exposes structured personal data memory to AI agents via Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Cross-platform: works with ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor

### 2.2 What Neotoma Does NOT Do

- **No automatic scanning:** We do not scan your email or cloud storage automatically
- **No email body reading:** We only process attachments you explicitly upload
- **No guessing or inferring:** Extraction is deterministic (rule-based in MVP)
- **No background data collection:** We only process data you explicitly provide via upload or MCP interaction
- **Not conversation-only:** Unlike provider memory (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini), Neotoma provides structured personal data memory with entity resolution and timelines
